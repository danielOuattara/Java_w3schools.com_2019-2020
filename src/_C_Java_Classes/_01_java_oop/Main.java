        /* Java - What is OOP ?
        ==========================

        OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
        ------------------------------------------
        Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform
        operations on the data.

        Object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data
        and methods.

        Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
          > faster and easier to execute
          > provides a clear structure for the programs
          > helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code
            easier to maintain, modify and debug
          > makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and
            shorter development time

        Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code.
             You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them
             at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.


        What are Classes and Objects ?
        ------------------------------
        Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
        Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:

        ----------------------------------
        class         |          objects
        --------------|-------------------
        Fruit         |          Apple
                      |          Banana
                      |          Mango
        --------------|-------------------
        Car           |          Volvo
                      |          Audit
                      |          Toyota
        ----------------------------------

        So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
        When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods
        from the class.
